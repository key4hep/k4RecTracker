# v00.06.00

* 2025-10-19 Andrea De Vita ([PR#65](https://github.com/key4hep/k4RecTracker/pull/65))
  - A new functional is available in `Tracking/components/GGTF_tracking.cpp`. It supports track finding using CLD, IDEA, and ALLEGRO detectors. The function returns `extension::Tracks` to ensure compatibility with IDEA and ALLEGRO, whose wire hits are not included in `edm4hep`. To run the track finder, you must specify the path to the trained model via the `SteeringFile`. A simple pre-trained model using IDEA v3 o1 is provided in the `test` folder as an example.
  - The utility functions previously used exclusively in Tracking/components/TracksFromGenParticles.cpp have been moved to Tracking/include/utils.hpp, making them accessible to other functional components as well.
  - `test_TracksFromGenParticles` now includes both the data production and the functional test. These two steps have been integrated into a single test, simplifying the workflow and reducing redundancy.
