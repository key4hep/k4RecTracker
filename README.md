# k4RecTracker

This repository hosts Gaudi components related to vertex and tracker reconstruction as well as tracking.

## Dependencies

* ROOT
* PODIO
* EDM4HEP
* Gaudi
* k4FWCore
* DD4HEP

## Installation

Cloning:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrieucF/k4RecTracker.git
```

Installing:

```bash
cd k4RecTracker
make
```

Setting the environment:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Fetching data:

```bash
make get_data
```

## Repository content

* `DCHdigi`: drift chamber digitization (for now, this step produces 'reco' collection)
* `ARCdigi`: ARC digitization (for now, this step produces 'reco' collection)
* `VTXdigi`: vertex detector digitization (for now, this step produces 'reco' collection)
* `Tracking`: tracking algorithms orchestrating [GenFit](https://github.com/GenFit/GenFit)

## Execute Examples 

```bash
k4run DCHdigi/test/runDCHsimpleDigitizer.py
```

```bash
k4run ARCdigi/test/runARCdigitizer.py
```

## Convention

For the syntax, try to follow the LLVM standards. You can format your code before to open a pull request with:

```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/contrib/clang/14.0.6/x86_64-centos7/setup.sh
clang-format -i path_to_your_file
```
